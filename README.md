# ResQueue

## About

ResQueue is a web-based app that brings the jukebox experience to modern bars and social venues. It allows patrons to request songs to be played by paying a small fee. This ensures that the music atmosphere in the venue is truly crowd-sourced and engaging. Additionally, we are introducing a bidding system for users who want their song choice to have priority in the queue.

The app is currently under development and not yet available for public use.
